# Evel Chemevol
A simple one-zone chemical evolution code

This is a place to store the chemical evolution code used in Shingles et al. (2014) and Shingles (2015, thesis).
No guarantees are made about its functionality or usefulness to outsiders.

Files in the yields directory are all sourced from either publications, open online databases, or my own data.
