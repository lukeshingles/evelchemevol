# Evel Chemevol
A one-zone closed-box chemical evolution code written in Fortran with OpenMP.

This is a place to store the chemical evolution code used in Shingles et al. (2014) and Shingles (2015, thesis).
No guarantees are made about its functionality or usefulness to others.

Files in the yields directory are all sourced from either publications, open online databases, or my own data.
